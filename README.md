# Tidy Labels for Todoist

Organise labels by alphabetising, using the same naming convention and assigning colors.

_This script is not created by, affiliated with, or supported by Doist._

## Usage

- Add your Todoist API key as an environment variable like `TODOIST_API_KEY`.
- `$ npm i` to install the dependencies.
- `$ npm run start` in the root of the project.

## Where did this come from?

I like the labelling system in Todoist but I couldn't find a way to make the feature work for me. After adding lots of labels it became cumbersome, so I wanted a clean way to tidy them up and so, this tool was born.
